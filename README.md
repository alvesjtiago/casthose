# Casthose ðŸš°

Casthose is a cast streaming platform connected directly to a [Farcaster hub]().

### Notes

We recommend using [Neynar]() if you want the best development experience for Farcaster.

## Getting Started

Casthose uses Next.js.

First install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Create a `.env` file by duplicating `.env.example` and updating it with the correct variable values.

Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to use Casthose.
You should start seeing casts appearing as soon as they're published.

## Deployment

Deployment is done automatically when merging to `main` branch.
